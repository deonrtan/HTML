    <h1>This is my personal page and I'd like to talk a little about myself</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I Like to listen to music, play video games, and study about programming. As a child I always dreamt of building
        or encoding some games with the use of coding and digital arts. I’m quite a shy kid and sometimes I can’t
        express the words I really want to meant that’s why I’m difficult to understand. I engage in my day to day with
        some music don’t matter if it’s early or late at night. Music helps me sooths my mind and somehow I got used to
        it. I adore some people who made a good story games especially those indie types of people means that they’re
        independent on the story they create. That’s what motivate me to made a game currently I only knew the basic
        types of programming a video game like using sprites, programming the interactions and mechanics of the game
        like interacting with other objects, pushing buttons, coding the change of sprites of an object or a character
        to make them visually realistic and great for the game surroundings and transition between rooms to rooms, like
        that type of basic types. It is my passion to learn about programming to procure making a video game. that is
        part of my bucketlist for my life</p>
